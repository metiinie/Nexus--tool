This project, NEXUS (Orion Tracking System), is a high-performance, gamified productivity ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between abstract project management and daily behavioral consistency.

1. Function of the Project for the Client
For the end user (the "Operator"), this project serves as a Strategic Command Center. Its primary functions are:

Behavioral Alignment: Converting boring habits into "Neural Patterns" that reward consistency with XP and levels.
Operational Control: Providing a high-stakes, tactical interface for managing tasks ("Operations") where "Critical" missions are visually prioritized over standard backlog.
Performance Visualization: Using real-time data to show "Sync Rates" (how well you stick to routines) and "Operational Efficiency" (how quickly you clear tasks).
Collaborative Intelligence: The "Squadron" feature allows teams to see each other's activity logs and progression, creating a competitive yet collaborative high-performance environment.
2. "Look-Alike" Tools (Market Comparisons)
NEXUS sits at the intersection of several premium tools:

Habitica: For the gamification and RPG elements (XP, Levels).
Linear: For the high-performance, keyboard-centric task management feel.
Notion: For the personal/team workspace aspect.
Superhuman: For the elite, futuristic aesthetic and "speed" focus.
Streaks: For the beautiful, minimal habit tracking visualization.
3. Currently Missing or Incomplete Functionality
While the core "Neural Link" (syncing, tasks, habits, and dashboard) is now robust, the following areas remain in the "Development Backlog":

A. System Configuration (Settings)
Incomplete: The sidebar has a "System Config" link, but it lacks a dedicated page to edit user bios, change passwords, or set visual preferences (e.g., toggling the scanline effects).
Target: A futuristic "Terminal" page for user identity management.
B. Deep Squadron Capabilities
Incomplete: Currently, you can join/create squads and see logs.
Missing: You cannot yet assign missions to specific operators within a squad or have a real-time Tactical Chat for the team.
C. Achievement Protocol (Awards)
Incomplete: We have Levels and XP.
Missing: A "Trophy Room" or Badge system to reward specific milestones (e.g., "7-Day Neural Streak" or "First Critical Operation Success").
D. Notification Uplink
Incomplete: The system is reactive.
Missing: An active notification system ("Neural Pings") to alert the user when a "Critical" task is nearing its deadline.
E. Data Sovereignty (Security)
Incomplete: We have JWT and basic cookies.
Missing: A "Forgot Password" flow via email and 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for the "high-security" theme.
F. Mobile Optimization
Incomplete: The mobile view is a functional fallback.
Missing: A complete "Mobile First" responsive redesign for the Task Board and Analytics, which are currently better viewed on a high-resolution desktop.
Summary: The "Engine" (Backend/Sync) and "Chassis" (Core UI) are complete and premium. The remaining work is "Cargo" (Feature Depth) and "Navigation" (Settings/Identity Management).
